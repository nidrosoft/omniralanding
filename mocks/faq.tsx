        title: "What systems does Omnira replace?",
        content:
            "Omnira replaces your practice management software (Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental), patient communication tools (Weave, RevenueWell), analytics platforms (Dental Intelligence), clearinghouse, and marketing tools — all in one platform.",

        title: "Is Omnira HIPAA compliant?",
        content:
            "Yes. HIPAA compliance is foundational to Omnira, not an add-on. End-to-end encryption, audit logs, BAA, role-based access, and the option to keep sensitive data on-premises with our hybrid architecture.",

        title: "How long does onboarding take?",
        content:
            "Most practices are fully onboarded within 1–2 weeks. We handle data migration from your existing systems and configure the agents for your specific workflows.",

        title: "What happens if the internet goes down?",
        content:
            "Core operations (scheduling, viewing records, check-in/check-out) continue working offline. AI agent actions pause and resume automatically when connectivity returns. You never lose access to your practice data.",

        id: "4",
        title: "Can I control what the agents do?",
        content:
            "Absolutely. Every agent operates within a 3-tier permission framework you configure: Autonomous (agent acts freely), Supervised (agent prepares, you approve), and Escalated (agent flags for your team). You start conservative and loosen over time.",

        id: "5",
        title: "How much does it cost?",
        content:
            "Omnira for Dental is priced at $1,500–$2,000/month — replacing $3,000+ in current software and admin labor costs. Waitlist members lock in founding member pricing for life.",

        title: "What if I already have Dentrix or Eaglesoft?",
        content:
            "Omnira is designed to fully replace your existing practice management software. We migrate your data and get you running on Omnira without disruption. You cancel your old subscriptions.",

        id: "7",
        title: "Is my data safe?",
        content:
            "Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit. You own it completely — it's always exportable and never shared with third parties. Our hybrid architecture means sensitive patient data can stay on-premises if you prefer.",

        title: "Can multiple staff members use it?",
        content:
            "Yes — unlimited users/seats included. Role-based access ensures each team member sees what they need: providers see clinical information, front desk sees scheduling and billing, office manager sees everything.",
