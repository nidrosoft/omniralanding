## 1. Product Overview

### What is Wellorna?

**Wellorna** is an AI-native operating system for practice-based businesses. It replaces the 5–10 fragmented software tools a practice uses today with a single, unified platform powered by autonomous AI agents that handle the repetitive administrative work — scheduling, insurance verification, billing, patient communication, compliance tracking — so staff can focus on patient care.

### Product Architecture

Wellorna is a **parent platform brand**. Each industry vertical gets its own product:

| Product | Vertical | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Wellorna for Dental** | Dental practices | v1 (launching first) |
| Wellorna for Veterinary | Veterinary clinics | Future |
| Wellorna for Optometry | Optometry/eye care | Future |
| Wellorna for Med Spa | Aesthetic/med spa clinics | Future |
| Wellorna for Chiropractic | Chiropractic practices | Future |

**This landing page focuses on Wellorna for Dental** as the launch vertical, while establishing Wellorna as a platform brand.

### The Core Value Proposition

> **"Your dental practice, running itself."**

Wellorna deploys 5 specialized AI agents that work 24/7 — overnight they process claims, verify tomorrow's insurance, follow up with inactive patients, and prepare a morning briefing so your team walks in ready to go. During the day, they fill cancellations in minutes, handle routine phone calls, submit claims same-day, and manage the entire billing cycle without human involvement.

**The result:** $250K–$500K+ in annual recovered revenue and cost savings for a mid-size practice. That's why $1,500–$2,000/month is a no-brainer.

### One-Liner Variants (for hero section A/B testing)

- "Your dental practice, running itself."
- "The AI operating system that runs your dental practice."
- "5 AI agents. One platform. Your practice on autopilot."
- "Stop managing software. Start running your practice."
- "The first OS built for the agent era."

## 6. Problem Statement Section

### Section Title
> "Your front desk is doing the work of 5 people. With 5 different tools."

### Content — The Pain Points

Present as a visual grid, cards, or alternating layout:

**Pain Point 1: Fragmented Software**
- The average dental practice pays for 5–10 separate software subscriptions
- None of them talk to each other
- Staff re-enters the same data across multiple systems
- *Typical monthly cost: $1,500–$3,000 just in software*

**Pain Point 2: Drowning Front Desk**
- Front desk handles 40–80 phone calls per day
- Insurance verification: 10–20 minutes per patient, manually
- 60–70% of their time is repetitive, rule-based work
- Every cancellation means a scramble to fill the slot
- *Result: Burnout, errors, and patients who wait*

**Pain Point 3: Revenue Leaking Everywhere**
- Claims batched weekly instead of submitted same-day → delayed payments
- Denied claims sit in a queue, often written off → $30–80K lost annually
- Unscheduled treatment never followed up → $100–300K sitting on the table
- Recall patients not contacted systematically → 40–50% don't return on time
- Cancellation slots go unfilled → $50–150K in lost chair time annually

**Pain Point 4: No Visibility**
- Practice owner checks the bank balance and guesses
- Monthly reports take hours to compile manually
- No real-time view of production, collections, or practice health
- Decisions made on gut feel, not data

### Closing Line for Section

## 7. Product Overview Section

### Section Title
> "Meet Wellorna — The AI operating system for your dental practice"

### What It Is (Short Paragraph)
Wellorna is a single platform that replaces your practice management software, patient communication tools, billing systems, analytics dashboards, and scheduling software. Instead of your staff clicking through 5 different tools, 5 AI agents operate inside one unified system — handling the work autonomously while your team supervises and focuses on what matters: patients.

### How It Works — 3 Steps (Visual with icons/illustrations)

**Step 1: Connect & Configure**
> Wellorna onboards your practice in days, not months. Import your patient data, configure your preferences, set agent permissions. Your agents learn your workflows.

**Step 2: Agents Go to Work**
> 5 specialized agents begin operating across scheduling, billing, communication, clinical support, and operations — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They handle the routine. You handle the exceptions.

**Step 3: You Stay in Control**
> Every action is logged. Every decision is reviewable. You configure what agents do autonomously vs. what needs your approval. Start conservative, loosen as you gain confidence.

### Agent Autonomy Framework (Visual — 3 Tiers)

| Tier | What It Means | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Autonomous** | Agent acts without asking. You pre-approved these. | Send reminders, verify insurance, submit clean claims, reorder supplies, send recall messages |
| 🟡 **Supervised** | Agent prepares the action, waits for your OK. | Appeal denied claims, respond to negative reviews, reschedule patients due to provider absence |
| 🔴 **Escalated** | Agent can't handle it. Creates a task for your team with full context. | Patient disputes, clinical questions, legal/liability issues, unhappy patients needing personal attention |

## 8. The 5 AI Agents — Feature Deep Dive

> **This is the anchor section of the landing page.** Each agent should feel like its own product. Use cards, tabs, or an interactive showcase.

---

### Agent 1: 📅 Scheduling Agent

**Tagline:** "Your calendar, optimized 24/7."

**What it owns:** The entire appointment calendar — booking, recalls, cancellations, waitlist, provider optimization.

**Key Capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Smart Booking** | Books appointments considering procedure type, duration, provider skills, equipment needs, patient preferences, and insurance status. Suggests optimal slots — doesn't just show a blank calendar. |
| **Cancellation Recovery** | The moment a cancellation hits, the agent texts 3–5 waitlist patients simultaneously. First to confirm gets the slot. 80%+ fill rate vs. the industry average of 10–20%. |
| **Recall System** | Manages the entire 6-month hygiene recall system. Sends a scheduling link → reminder → personal message from the hygienist. Tracks overdue patients and escalates outreach. A well-run recall system is worth $200K+/year. |
| **No-Show Prevention** | Tracks no-show patterns per patient. Sends confirmation sequences (7 days, 48 hours, 24 hours before). After 3 no-shows, flags patient for deposit requirement. Predicts no-show likelihood and suggests double-booking high-risk slots. |
| **Schedule Optimization** | Balances daily schedule: high-production procedures during peak energy hours, buffer time between complex cases, emergency slots held open, assistants/hygienists efficiently utilized across chairs. |
| **Waitlist Management** | Automated priority waitlist. When slots open, patients are contacted instantly by text. Self-select from available times via link. No phone tag. |

**Impact Stat:** *15–25% increase in chair utilization. $50–150K in saved cancellation revenue.*

---

### Agent 2: 💰 Billing & Revenue Agent

**Tagline:** "Every dollar accounted for. Every claim submitted same-day."

**What it owns:** The entire revenue cycle — from insurance verification through final patient payment.

**Key Capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Insurance Verification** | Automatically verifies eligibility and benefits for every patient before every visit. Pulls: plan details, annual maximum + amount used, deductible + amount met, coverage percentages by category, waiting periods, frequency limitations, coordination of benefits. Re-verifies 48 hours before appointment. |
| **Treatment Estimates** | Generates accurate cost breakdowns: procedure codes, fee schedule amounts, insurance coverage %, estimated insurance payment, estimated patient responsibility, payment plan options. Presented to patients before treatment begins — no billing surprises. |
| **Same-Day Claims** | After every visit: compiles claim (CDT codes, tooth numbers, surfaces, narratives), validates against payer-specific rules, attaches required documentation (X-rays, perio charting), submits electronically through clearinghouse. Claims go out the same day — not batched weekly. |
| **Denial Management** | Reads denial reason codes, categorizes the issue, and acts: correctable denials are fixed and resubmitted automatically. Complex denials get appeal packages prepared with documentation and queued for staff review. Tracks outcomes and learns which strategies work per payer. Most practices write off 5–10% of production. This agent recovers it. |
| **Claim Tracking** | Real-time dashboard: submitted, pending, paid, denied, appealed. Flags claims not adjudicated within expected timeframe. Posts insurance payments and reconciles against expected amounts. No claim is ever forgotten. |
| **Patient Billing Cycle** | After insurance pays: calculates remaining balance, sends electronic statement with clear explanation, offers online payment, follows up on configurable schedule (30/60/90 days), flags for collections at practice-defined threshold. The entire cycle runs without staff involvement. |
| **Predetermination & Pre-Auth** | For major procedures (crowns, bridges, implants): submits predetermination with documentation, tracks response, updates treatment plan with approved amounts, notifies patient and scheduling when approved. |
| **Payment Plans** | Offers configurable payment plan options, sets up recurring charges, sends reminders, handles missed payments with grace period and follow-up, provides dashboard of all active plans. |

**Impact Stat:** *40–60% reduction in claim rejections. $30–80K recovered annually from denied claims. Claims paid 2–3 weeks faster.*

---

### Agent 3: 📞 Communication Agent

**Tagline:** "Every patient touchpoint, handled."

**What it owns:** All inbound and outbound patient communication across every channel — text, email, phone, portal.

**Key Capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **AI Phone System** | Handles routine incoming calls: practice hours & directions, simple appointment scheduling, appointment confirmations/rescheduling, prescription refill requests (routed to provider), insurance questions (looks up answers in real-time). Routes complex calls to the right staff member with full context. Provides transcript and summary of every call. Handles 50–70% of call volume without a human. |
| **Appointment Reminders** | Configurable sequence: 7 days (email), 48 hours (text, reply to confirm), 24 hours (final reminder + outstanding forms). If unconfirmed, flags for staff and checks waitlist for potential fill. |
| **Post-Procedure Follow-Up** | After procedures: sends care instructions specific to the procedure (extraction care, post-crown instructions, etc.), check-in message 24–48 hours later, triages pain/complication reports to clinical team, satisfaction survey. Dramatically reduces after-hours calls. |
| **Review Management** | After each visit: sends satisfaction check. Happy patients → direct link to leave Google review. Unhappy patients → routed to office manager privately before they post publicly. Agent drafts personalized responses to all online reviews within 2 hours. |
| **Reactivation Campaigns** | For patients inactive 12+ months: friendly reminder they're overdue → special offer (if practice does promotions) → personal message from hygienist/dentist → after 3 attempts, marked inactive. Systematically addresses attrition most practices just accept. |
| **Unscheduled Treatment Follow-Up** | Tracks all diagnosed but unscheduled treatment. Follows up at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months with personalized messaging about why the treatment matters. Escalates persistent cases for personal calls. Mid-size practices have $100–300K in unscheduled treatment at any time. |
| **Birthday & Milestone Messages** | Birthdays, patient anniversaries, cavity-free milestones. Builds loyalty, keeps practice top-of-mind. |
| **Emergency Triage** | Triages emergency contacts using clinical protocols: provides immediate care instructions, identifies available emergency slots, alerts on-call provider for true emergencies. |

**Impact Stat:** *50–70% reduction in phone volume. Patient reactivation recovery. Unscheduled treatment worth $50–200K recovered annually.*

### Agent 4: 📋 Clinical Support Agent

**Tagline:** "Your clinical team's documentation backbone."

**What it owns:** Treatment planning, referrals, prescriptions, lab coordination, clinical documentation.

**Key Capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Treatment Plan Presentation** | Formats treatment plans into patient-friendly documents: clear language (not just CDT codes), cost estimates with insurance coverage, phased plans with sequencing, visual showing affected teeth, payment/financing options. Dentist reviews with patient — agent did all prep work. |
| **Unscheduled Treatment Tracking** | Maintains a real-time list of all diagnosed but unscheduled treatment across all patients. Feeds data to Communication Agent for follow-up sequences. Tracks conversion rates to optimize messaging. |
| **Referral Management** | End-to-end: generates referral letter with clinical info, sends to specialist with records and X-rays, notifies patient with specialist contact info, tracks whether patient scheduled, follows up if not within 2 weeks, requests and files specialist's report. The referral loop is currently broken in most practices — this closes it. |
| **E-Prescriptions** | Checks allergies and drug interactions, generates e-prescription, sends to patient's preferred pharmacy, logs in record. For controlled substances: ensures DEA compliance. Handles refill requests by routing to provider with context. |
| **Lab Case Management** | For crowns, bridges, dentures, night guards: generates lab Rx with shade/material/specs, sends to lab with digital impressions, tracks through lab workflow, alerts on shipment/delivery, confirms arrival before seat appointment. If delayed: alerts staff and proactively reschedules. |
| **Clinical Notes Assistance** | Auto-populates standard procedure notes by CDT code, voice-to-text for custom notes, flags charting inconsistencies (e.g., procedure on tooth already extracted), generates patient-friendly visit summaries. |
| **Medical History Flagging** | Reviews medical history and flags conditions relevant to dental treatment: blood thinners, bisphosphonates, diabetes, heart conditions requiring premedication, allergies, pregnancy. Flags appear prominently in the chart. |

**Impact Stat:** *Higher treatment acceptance rates. Closed referral loops. Safer prescribing. $50–200K in unscheduled treatment recovered.*

---

### Agent 5: 📊 Operations Agent

**Tagline:** "Your practice intelligence, always on."

**What it owns:** Daily operations, inventory, compliance, HR, reporting, analytics.

**Key Capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Morning Briefing** | Generated overnight, ready by 7 AM: today's schedule with patient notes (outstanding treatment, insurance issues, special needs), production goal vs. likely production, patients needing confirmation, lab cases expected (with tracking), outstanding tasks from yesterday, AR items needing attention, birthday patients. Replaces 20–30 min of manual prep. |
| **Inventory Management** | Tracks levels based on usage patterns and upcoming schedule. Predictive ordering: if 10 crowns are scheduled next week, ensures sufficient materials. Auto-reorders at thresholds. Compares prices across vendors. Tracks expiration dates. Monthly supply cost analysis benchmarked against industry. |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Tracks every deadline: HIPAA training renewals, OSHA certifications, provider license renewals, DEA registration, CE requirements, radiology certifications, autoclave testing schedules. Alerts at 90/60/30 days. Generates compliance reports for inspections. |
| **Staff Management** | Manages staff schedules (paired with providers), PTO tracking, payroll data prep (hours, production bonuses, overtime), performance reports per provider/hygienist. Integrates with ADP, Gusto, or QuickBooks Payroll. |
| **Daily/Monthly Reporting** | Daily dashboard: scheduled production vs. goal, collections, patients seen, open chair time, outstanding tasks. Monthly report: production/collections, new patients by source, active patient trends, recall effectiveness, case acceptance rate, AR aging, supply costs, production per provider. Auto-generated — would cost $2–5K/month from a dental consultant. |
| **Predictive Analytics** | Revenue forecasting, patient attrition prediction, optimal scheduling patterns, insurance mix profitability analysis, staffing needs projection. Gets smarter over time. |
| **Benchmarking** | Compares practice KPIs against industry benchmarks and (eventually) anonymized platform-wide data. Shows where the practice excels and where there's room to grow. |
| **Accounting Integration** | Syncs with QuickBooks, Xero, etc.: daily production/collection entries, expense categorization, payroll data, AR reconciliation. Accountant gets clean, organized data. |
| **End-of-Day Processing** | Runs automatically: reconciles payments, identifies unsubmitted claims, generates production report, prepares next-day briefing, sends final confirmations for tomorrow. |

**Impact Stat:** *Morning prep: 5 min instead of 30. Never run out of supplies. Never miss a compliance deadline. Real-time visibility into practice health.*

## 9. Workflow Showcase Section

### Section Title
> "See it in action — before and after"

### Format
Interactive tabs or side-by-side comparisons. Show 4–6 key workflows.

### Workflow 1: Cancellation Recovery

| Without Wellorna | With Wellorna |
|---|---|
| Patient cancels at 9 AM. Front desk notices, pulls out the paper waitlist, starts calling patients one by one between other tasks. By 11 AM, the slot is still empty. The practice lost $400–800 in production. | Patient cancels at 9 AM. Scheduling Agent identifies the slot's production value, texts 5 waitlist patients simultaneously. First to confirm gets the slot. Slot filled by 9:15 AM. Front desk never interrupted. |

### Workflow 2: Insurance Verification

| Without Wellorna | With Wellorna |
|---|---|
| Front desk calls the insurance company or logs into a separate portal. Put on hold for 10–20 minutes. Manually notes benefits, maximums, deductibles. Repeats for every patient. Often done day-of, causing delays and surprises at checkout. | Billing Agent verifies automatically when patient books. Pulls complete benefit breakdown (eligibility, plan details, annual max used, deductible met, coverage by category, waiting periods, frequency limits). Re-verifies 48 hours before. 100% of patients verified before arrival. Zero staff time. |

### Workflow 3: Claim Denial

| Without Wellorna | With Wellorna |
|---|---|
| EOB arrives showing claim denied. Goes in a pile. Someone looks at it when they have time. Most denials are never reworked. Practice writes off 5–10% of production annually. | Billing Agent reads the denial reason code, categorizes it, and acts. Correctable denials: fixed and resubmitted automatically within 24 hours. Complex denials: appeal prepared with documentation and queued for staff review. Outcomes tracked — agent learns what works per payer. |

### Workflow 4: Patient Recall

| Without Wellorna | With Wellorna |
|---|---|
| Someone runs a recall report and prints a list. Calls patients when there's time. Many never get called. Industry recall effectiveness: 50–60%. Lost patients = lost revenue. | Communication Agent manages the entire sequence: scheduling link → reminder → personal message from hygienist → escalation for overdue patients. Tracks everything. Recall effectiveness: 80–90%. A well-run recall system is worth $200K+/year. |

### Workflow 5: End of Day

| Without Wellorna | With Wellorna |
|---|---|
| Staff rushes to check out last patients, collect payments, close out. Unsubmitted claims wait until tomorrow. No one contacted unconfirmed patients for the next day. Staff leaves exhausted. | Check-out is fast — statements auto-generated, payments processed, next appointments booked. Operations Agent runs end-of-day: reconciles payments, submits remaining claims, sends final confirmations for tomorrow, updates AR, prepares next day's morning briefing. Staff leaves on time. |

### Workflow 6: New Patient Onboarding

| Without Wellorna | With Wellorna |
|---|---|
| Patient arrives, fills out 15 minutes of paper forms in the lobby. Front desk manually enters data into the system. Insurance card photocopied and verified manually. Errors are common. | Digital forms sent automatically when patient books. Patient completes on their phone at home. Data flows directly into the record — zero manual entry. Insurance card photo uploaded and auto-parsed. Insurance verified in real-time before they walk in. Patient arrives ready to be seen. |

## 15. Technical Notes for Developer

### Tech Stack Guidance
- **Framework:** Use whatever your template supports (React/Next.js, Astro, etc.)
- **Hosting:** Vercel, Netlify, or similar
- **Analytics:** PostHog, Plausible, or Mixpanel for waitlist conversion tracking
- **Waitlist backend:** Supabase (already selected as the database), or simple email collector (Loops, Resend, etc.)
- **Animations:** Subtle. Framer Motion or GSAP for scroll reveals. No flashy gimmicks.
- **Performance:** Target 95+ Lighthouse score. Optimize images. Lazy load below-fold.
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first. Many practice owners will view on their phone.

### SEO Targets
- Primary keyword: "dental practice management software"
- Secondary: "AI dental practice OS", "dental office automation", "dental practice AI agents"
- Meta title: "Wellorna — The AI Operating System for Dental Practices"
- Meta description: "Replace 5–10 software tools with one platform. 5 AI agents handle scheduling, billing, insurance, patient communication, and operations 24/7. Join the waitlist."

### Key User Actions to Track
1. Waitlist form submission (primary conversion)
2. Scroll depth (how far do visitors get?)
3. Section engagement (which agent cards get clicked?)
4. Time on page
5. CTA clicks (hero vs. bottom vs. sticky nav)

### FAQ Content

**Q: What systems does Wellorna replace?**
A: Wellorna replaces your practice management software (Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental), patient communication tools (Weave, RevenueWell), analytics platforms (Dental Intelligence), clearinghouse, and marketing tools — all in one platform.

**Q: Is Wellorna HIPAA compliant?**
A: Yes. HIPAA compliance is foundational to Wellorna, not an add-on. End-to-end encryption, audit logs, BAA, role-based access, and the option to keep sensitive data on-premises with our hybrid architecture.

**Q: How long does onboarding take?**
A: Most practices are fully onboarded within 1–2 weeks. We handle data migration from your existing systems and configure the agents for your specific workflows.

**Q: What happens if the internet goes down?**
A: Core operations (scheduling, viewing records, check-in/check-out) continue working offline. AI agent actions pause and resume automatically when connectivity returns. You never lose access to your practice data.

**Q: Can I control what the agents do?**
A: Absolutely. Every agent operates within a 3-tier permission framework you configure: Autonomous (agent acts freely), Supervised (agent prepares, you approve), and Escalated (agent flags for your team). You start conservative and loosen over time.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Wellorna for Dental is priced at $1,500–$2,000/month — replacing $3,000+ in current software and admin labor costs. Waitlist members lock in founding member pricing for life.

**Q: What if I already have Dentrix/Eaglesoft?**
A: Wellorna is designed to fully replace your existing practice management software. We migrate your data and get you running on Wellorna without disruption. You cancel your old subscriptions.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit. You own it completely — it's always exportable and never shared with third parties. Our hybrid architecture means sensitive patient data can stay on-premises if you prefer.

**Q: What happens to my data if I cancel?**
A: Your data is yours. We provide a full export in standard formats. No lock-in, ever.

**Q: Can multiple staff members use it?**
A: Yes — unlimited users/seats included. Role-based access ensures each team member sees what they need: providers see clinical information, front desk sees scheduling and billing, office manager sees everything.
